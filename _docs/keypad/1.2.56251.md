## Bell button press during pin insertion clears entered digits of the pin
Before that, when you partially enter the pin and press the bell button you've got two signalizations:
1. Success light and sound for bell button feature.
2. Error light and sound because of timeout on pin insertion.
 
From now, the user in such case will not see error signalization of pin insertion timeout:
 
1. Enter part of the pin.
2. Press the bell button to notify users that you are in front of the door.
3. Entered part of the pin is discarded.

## Battery type setup
There is main two types of batteries:
- not rechargeable - alkaline with nominal voltage 1,5V
- rechargeable - commonly NiMH chemistry with nominal voltage 1,2V

From now keypad supports battery indicator for rechargeable ones.\
If you decide to change the battery type in your Keypad you have to change it in Keypad settings in the mobile app.\
If there will be a wrong battery type set then your battery level indicator will be wrong.

## Disable keypad if its rechargeable batteries will be discharged
Below 15% you will receive notification that your keypad batteries are low and need replacement.\
If you omit replacement of batteries and its voltage drop below 1,1V per AAA battery then we disable Keypad at all.\
It is done because your rechargeable batteries can be damaged without the possibility to charge them again.
