## Fixed issue with faulty red led signalization after device startup 

In the previous release we fixed this problem on lock, there was a possibility that the lock will faultily signalize an error after lock startup.\
We discovered it could also happen on the keypad so proper changes were introduced to make sure it won't be replicated.
