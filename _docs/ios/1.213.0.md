## Fixed an issue where the Gate could not be opened when the "Hold to unlock" feature was enabled.
We fixed issue with button that should open the gate. Now, this button will work properly even when "Hold to unlock" feature is enabled.

## Resolved a problem with duplicated app settings when Flight Mode was enabled.
There was an issue with app settings page when Flight mode was enabled. Content of this screen was displayed multiple times but now it will show correct content every time.
