## Fix rare issue that could block processing of BLE communication
We fixed a rare problem that could sometimes interrupt the app’s Bluetooth connection with your devices. This means more reliable connections and smoother interactions, especially when connecting, reconnecting, or using the app for longer periods of time.

## Fix issue with loading long list of device activities
In some cases, the app didn’t display the full list of your device activities, even though more were available. This issue has been resolved, and your complete activity history will now load correctly so you don’t miss any past events.

## Fix issue with providing currently connected WiFi name in advance auto-unlock settings page
The button used to set the Wi‑Fi network in the advanced auto‑unlock settings was not working correctly. This has now been fixed, allowing you to properly select and save your Wi‑Fi network when configuring auto‑unlock rules.

## Fix cut off loading view on my devices page
We fixed a visual issue where the loading indicator on the My Devices page wasn’t fully visible on some screens. The loading state is now displayed correctly.
