## Dropped support for iOS 14 and iOS 15
To ensure that we can deliver the best experience and newest features, we decided to drop support for iOS 14 and iOS 15. This version is not available for iPhones running iOS 14 or iOS 15. Users of iOS 14 or iOS 15 can still use last available for them version of the application but we cannot guarantee how long it will be working with our devices.

## Added external power information for Keypad Pro
For Keypad Pro, we added information about whether external power is connected to the Keypad Pro or not. This information can be found in Keypad Pro settings page.\
