## Redesigned accessory pairing process
We added "Unable to pair" section that inform user about his other devices in Bluetooth range that cannot be paired with selected accessory and why. Also, we added section that should help in case when desired lock is not on the list.\

## Lock accessories can now be paired directly from the lock settings
We added possibility to pair and unpair lock accessories from lock settings. This process is the same as pairing lock accessory with lock, instead of that, here user will select lock accessory that he want to pair with selected lock.\

## Prevented Auto-unlock from starting immediately after turning on the iPhone
We added mechanism that will prevent auto-unlock from starting if iPhone was turn on within last 5 minutes. This should prevent situation when users went back to home with his iPhone turned off (e.g. empty battery) and after iPhone was turned on, auto-unlock could be started.
