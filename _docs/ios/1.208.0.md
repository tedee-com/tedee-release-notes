## New Dry Contact configuration

With new firmware version of Dry Contact it is now possible to configure Dry Contact by selecting one of predefined templates instead of manually setting signals configuration.
Dry Contact which is added to account for the first time requires signals configuration. By default it will not accept any signals and not send any signals.
