## Added meaningful information when user attempts to log in with an unsupported Microsoft work account
When a user tries to log in with a Microsoft work account from an organization that has not yet been set up for Tedee logins, they will now see a clear message explaining the situation. The message includes a link to a request form that allows the organization to enable Microsoft work account logins.
The form is available [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=ibO271oOn0SweG6SXqsY5kvj7QFAE0pAmY4DVH7Ial1UOUtDVDNVS1dFT1ZIUDFRNUtSTkpNMVhOSiQlQCN0PWcu)\
