## Added the ability to import contacts from the phone when creating a new device share
When creating new device share, user has now ability to import the phone contacts. Only contacts that have email address will be imported. To do this, there is contact book icon in right top corner which will present permission alert and after granting contact permissions to the app, contacts will be loaded and presented on the known users list. This will be done only once and after that, contacts will be loaded every time that user will enter the "Whom to invite" page.

> Imported phone contacts are not stored by the application. App will load all phone contacts that has email address every time the user enter the "Whom to invite page" and after leaving this page, phone contacts are removed from the app.
