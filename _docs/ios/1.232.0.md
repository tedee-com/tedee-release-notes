## Preview: Possibility to enable or disable "Swipe to unlock" on "My devices" page
We’ve added a new setting in the app settings that allows users to enable or disable the "Swipe to unlock" feature. This feature lets users unlock door locks, gates with a simple swipe gesture directly from the "My Devices" page—offering a fast and intuitive way to access their smart devices.

The setting is only visible when the swipe to unlock preview feature is enabled.

## Fixed rare case where the lock status might not update properly
We’ve addressed a rare issue where the app could display an incorrect lock status for a door. In certain situations, the status shown in the app did not reflect the actual state of the lock. Only after the user changed the lock status again did the app begin to show the correct information.
With this fix, lock status updates are now accurate and timely, ensuring that users always see the correct state of their devices.
