## The Nearby widget now works faster when all user locks have Auto-unlock configured.
To make nearby widget faster, we introduce new logic that will check if all locks that user has access, have auto-unlock configured and if user is inside auto-unlock zone of one of his lock. If yes, nearby widget will skip discovery phase and will immediately start new connection to the lock. This change should result with faster unlock action from the nearby widget.

## Support for legacy iOS widgets has been removed.
Support for legacy iOS widgets has been removed and there will be no possibility to add and use them any more.

## Improved user experience for the Nearby widget.
The nearby widget will properly react on user action and update his state.

## Fixed an issue where finalizing a firmware update failed if the user left the application before the device rebooted.
We fixed an issue that prevent application from finishing firmware update process when user has left the app when update process reached 100% but the device didn't yet rebooted. Now, when user will go back to the app, new connection to the device will be made and update process will be finalize.
