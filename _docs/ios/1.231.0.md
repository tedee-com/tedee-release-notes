## In Preview: Swipe to unlock the lock or gate from the My Devices page.
You can now swipe to unlock your door lock or gate directly from the My Devices page — a faster, more intuitive way to access your devices!

### How it works:
- Just swipe left on your door lock or gate in the My Devices list to reveal the unlock option.
- For door locks, swipe to unlock is available when:
  - The lock is closed or semi-locked
  - Or the lock is unlocked and the Pull Spring feature is enabled and configured
- For gates, swipe to unlock is available as long as the gate isn’t already open
