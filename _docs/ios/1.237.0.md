## Introduced Matter support for Lock Go (requires firmware 2.1)

This release introduces __Matter support for Lock Go__, allowing the lock to integrate seamlessly with Matter‑compatible smart home platforms. With this enhancement, users gain broader interoperability, easier setup, and improved flexibility when connecting their lock to different smart home systems.

To enable Matter, make sure that __Lock Go is updated to firmware version 2.1 or newer__. Once the lock is updated, you can add it to your Matter ecosystem and enjoy a unified smart home experience across supported apps and devices.

## Added support for configuring multiple Wi‑Fi names for Auto‑unlock Wi‑Fi checks

The Check Wi‑Fi feature prevents Auto‑Unlock from starting when your phone is connected to specific Wi‑Fi networks—typically your home Wi‑Fi. This ensures Auto‑Unlock doesn't run unnecessarily when you are already safely inside your house.
Some users, however, have multiple Wi‑Fi names within the same home environment (for example, Home, Home‑2.4, Home‑Guest, etc.). In these setups, the phone may connect to any of these networks depending on signal strength or band switching. Previously, only one Wi‑Fi name could be configured, which meant Check Wi‑Fi didn't always block Auto‑Unlock as intended.
With this update, you can now configure multiple Wi‑Fi names for Check Wi‑Fi. This ensures that Auto‑Unlock consistently stays paused whenever your phone is connected to any of your home networks, providing more reliable and predictable behavior for users with multi‑SSID setups.

## Improved visibility of the Privacy Policy pop-up when extra‑large font sizes are enabled

This update enhances accessibility by ensuring the privacy policy popup remains visible and readable even when the system font size is set to extra‑large. Some users were unable to see or accept the policy due to text scaling issues. The interface has been adjusted so that the popup displays correctly in all supported font sizes, making it easier for everyone to review and confirm the privacy policy.

## Fixed an issue where the “Scroll to Top” button didn’t work on the My Devices page

We resolved a problem that caused the “scroll to top” button to stop responding under certain conditions. Navigation through longer device lists now works smoothly again, and tapping the button instantly takes you back to the top.

## Fixed an issue where the lock status could remail stuck when certain errors occurred during lock operations

Some users experienced situations where the lock status remained frozen after an unexpected error during locking or unlocking. This update ensures the app always refreshes and displays the correct lock state, even when errors occur.

## Fixed an issue where Auto‑unlock failed to start after leaving and re-entering the Auto‑unlock zone

The Check Wi‑Fi feature prevents Auto‑Unlock from starting when your phone is connected to specific Wi‑Fi networks—typically your home Wi‑Fi. This ensures Auto‑Unlock doesn't run unnecessarily when you are already safely inside your house.
