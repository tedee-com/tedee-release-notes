## iOS 18: New gate widget
A new widget is now available for opening gates.
Users can control gates directly from the widget—either locally (when the gate’s location is configured) or remotely.

## Unlock widget now works via Bluetooth by default
The unlock widget now connects via Bluetooth by default.
If the lock is paired with a Bridge and the user has remote access enabled, it can also operate over the internet.
Newly added widgets will default to Bluetooth for faster, local unlocking.

Fixed an issue that caused slow performance when viewing the device list with more than 50 devices.
