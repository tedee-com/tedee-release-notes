## Fixed an issue when switching accounts after signing in to the same account
Fixed an issue where the app would get stuck on the loading screen when switching accounts and signing back into the same account.

## Fixed an issue where the locking/unlocking state was displayed for too long when there was an internet connectivity problem
Improved the responsiveness of the locking/unlocking screen during connectivity issues.
Previously, when the internet connection was unstable, the locking/unlocking status could remain visible for up to 60 seconds before showing an alert with the option to retry via Bluetooth. Now, this alert appears after just 15 seconds, making the experience faster and less confusing.
