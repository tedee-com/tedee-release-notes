## Today's view widgets are no longer available on iOS 18+

With introduction of iOS 18 Apple has removed support for Today's view widgets which were configurable in Tedee App (Actions and Devices widgets).
As those widgets are no longer available we have removed widget's configuration section for iOS 18+ devices. New type of widget, the Nearby Access widgets works without any changes.
