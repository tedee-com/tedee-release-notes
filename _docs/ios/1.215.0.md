## Updated designs of the lock details page
To simplify the user experience, we changed how the lock details page is working. Now, each buttons on the bottom of the screen is controlling which tab is presented. That means, when user wants to open lock settings page, user will see lock settings page instead of lock details page. Previously, user was navigated to the new screen that contains lock settings page.\

## Fixed temporary display of the uncalibrated state for locks connected via BLE after the app was killed and relaunched
We fixed issue that could present incorrect lock state for locks connected via BLE after killing and re-launching the app. Incorrect lock state was presented for few seconds followed by the lock disconnection and after the app was connected to the lock again, correct lock state was presented.
