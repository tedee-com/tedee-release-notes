## Fixed issue with faulty or lack of the battery level readings 

There was a possibility that sometimes the battery would not be measured and the user couldn't see its state. Now it is more reliable.

## Auto-unlock will be canceled when the last unlock operation is performed less than 2 minutes before.

Deeper analysis of the Auto-unlock showed that in some circumstances the Auto-unlock procedure should be canceled by the lock itself. We found the cases when multiple mobile devices triggered multiple Auto-unlock processes while in range with the lock. Due to a different response time, one of the devices could send unwanted unlock requests while the owner was already inside the apartment. This feature is designed to prevent the Auto-unlocking while the user is already at home. Reduced time (from 3 minutes to 2 minutes) should help increase the possibility that the next person with active Auto-unlock is able to unlock the lock automatically.
