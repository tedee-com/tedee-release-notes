## Fixed issue with faulty or lack of the battery level readings 

There was a possibility that sometimes the battery would not be measured and the user couldn't see its state. Now it is more reliable.

## Auto-unlock will be canceled when the last unlock operation is performed less than 2 minutes before.

Analysis of user reports about auto-unlock failures showed that sometimes we have to cancel that feature on the Lock site. There were cases when two or more clients returned home at the same time with auto-unlock functionality turned on. Mobile phones have very different response times which could cause the tedee app is not to wake up. Then the app can wake up when the user is already inside of his apartment. The finish of the auto-unlock procedure shouldn't take place in such a case. This feature is designed to prevent auto-unlocking the doors when a user is already at home. Reduced time (from 3 minutes to 2 minutes) should help increase the possibility that the next user with active auto-unlock can unlock the Lock.
