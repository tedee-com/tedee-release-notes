## Fixed activity logs stopped arriving
There was an issue that activity logs were stored in lock memory but could not be sent to the tedee cloud.
Lock needed to be rebooted to start sending stored and new activities again.

## Fixed losing random activity logs
There were situations where some activities in history were missing.

## Fixed losing calibration after firmware updates
Sometimes after firmware update calibration of the lock was necessary.
Additionally, instead of firmware update activity there was logged power on.
