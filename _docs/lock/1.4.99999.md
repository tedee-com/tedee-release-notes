## Added feature of gathering the logs directly from the device using the mobile application.

In previous versions to get BLE logs from the device user need to:
- enable logs in the tedee app,
- find the app able to gather such logs.

From now our the tedee application 1.143.0 (Android, iOS) can gather such logs and share them with the tedee support if needed.
