## Locking from the keypad

From that version, a user is able to lock the lock via keypad with or without a pin. 
The way of locking depends on keypad settings.

If a pin was inserted then a proper activity log is created with a pin alias.
If there was locking without a pin then an activity log is created without a pin alias.

## Fixed faulty startup sequence signalization

In the last version 1.4.56389, there was a possibility that the lock will faulty signalize an error after lock startup.
The user was able to see misleading red blinks for around 2mins, whereas there was everything ok with the lock.

## Increased lock movement timeout to 9 seconds

Some users have very long lock mechanisms (4 full rotations from locked to unlocked positions).
Our too short timeout caused some fake jams. Taking that into account, we have decided to increase lock movement timeout to 9 seconds.
