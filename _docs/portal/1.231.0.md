## Reorder items in organization
The organization navigation has been reordered to improve user experience. Devices are now displayed as the first page when an organization loads, providing immediate access to the most frequently used functionality. The permissions page has been moved to where devices were previously located in the navigation structure.

## Performance improvements
Several performance optimizations have been implemented to enhance the portal experience:

* Assigning permissions for single device to multiple users
* Assigning and unassigning devices from organization
* Granting access for many devices to single user
* Opening grant device access sidebar
* Permissions matrix page optimization
