## Transfer ownership
The Transfer Ownership feature allows the transfer of ownership for individual devices within an organization. This option is accessible through the device list's context menu for each device, as well as in the device details context menu.

**Requirements for Transferring Ownership**:

The new owner must have a Tedee account. He doesn't need to be a member of the organization. To assign ownership, simply enter the user's email address or choose organization user from list.
The device must not have any paired devices associated with it.

**Note**: All shared access permissions associated with the transferred device will remain unchanged after the ownership transfer is completed.
