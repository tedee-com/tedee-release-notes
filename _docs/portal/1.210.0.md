## Lock accessories page
The Accessories page is a new addition under the Lock Details section in the Device Details tabs. It displays all accessories paired with a specific lock, excluding the bridge, which manages cloud communication. This page replaces all previous sections showing paired devices in the main Device Details view, making it easier to view connected devices in one place.
