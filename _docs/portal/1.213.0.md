## 'Stay signed in' feature
Users now have the option to extend their logged-in session for up to 30 days. The "Stay signed in" checkbox is below the password input field on the login screen. When selected, users remain logged in without needing to reauthenticate daily. The session stays active until the user logs out or reaches the 30-day limit, providing a more seamless and convenient login experience.
