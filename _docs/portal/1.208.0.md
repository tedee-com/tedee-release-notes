## Transfer ownership with paired devices
The Transfer Ownership feature now supports transferring paired devices and unpairing devices that are not intended for transfer. During the transfer process, you can manage devices through two lists:

1. Devices to Transfer:
This list displays the devices selected for transfer. All connections between these devices will be retained during the ownership transfer.

2. Suggested Devices:
This list shows devices that are paired with at least one device on the "Devices to Transfer" list. If any suggested devices remain in this list, they will automatically be unpaired from the devices being transferred and will stay with the original owner.

This feature provides control over which paired devices are transferred and ensures that unintended devices are unpaired and retained by the existing owner.
