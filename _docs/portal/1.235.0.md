## Features

* **Move devices between organizations**: Organization admins can now transfer multiple devices to another organization where they hold owner or admin rights. To ensure security and consistency:
  - Devices are moved alongside all paired components.
  - Equivalent access levels are automatically established in the destination organization.
  - Required users or user groups are created in the destination if they don't already exist.
  - Existing access links are cleaned up before the transfer is completed.

* **Bulk copy permissions**: Streamline access management by copying sets of permissions from one user or group to multiple recipients. 
  - Admins can select multiple permissions and use the "Copy To" interface to choose target users or groups.
  - Selected permissions will overwrite existing ones for the recipients upon confirmation.
  - The UI provides clear feedback on successful updates or specifically skipped users/groups.
