## Added feature to restore calibration settings after replacing batteries.
A new feature has been introduced to restore calibration settings after replacing batteries. The lock will signal an SOS using a blue LED to inform the user about the need to restore calibration settings. The user should then press a button once. The lock will enter the calibration state and perform a movement in the unlocking direction. Upon successful completion of the process, the lock will be left in the unlocked state.
