## The settings page of a disconnected device has a common design across all device types
We’ve introduced a consistent design for the settings page across all device types when they are in a disconnected state. This update ensures that key information—such as connection status, battery level, lock position, and door status—is displayed in a uniform and intuitive way, regardless of the device you own. By standardizing these elements, we’ve made it easier for you to quickly understand the status of your devices and manage them seamlessly, even when they’re offline.

## Fixed wrong lock state icon for unknown state
Corrected the icon shown on my devices page when a lock is in an unknown state.

## Improved: Auto-unlock reliability
Addressed multiple Auto-unlock issues reported by users, including cases where Auto-unlock didn't work, stopped working, or behaved inconsistently.

## Fixed: Pull spring status when feature is off
Resolved incorrect pull spring status being shown when the Pull Spring feature is disabled.
