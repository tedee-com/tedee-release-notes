## Changes in Auto-unlock ranges
We changed Auto-unlock ranges that are available to select. Based on usage statistics we simplified zone ranges for your convenience. Now you will be able to select in zone in range 100-500 m and out zone in range 150-600 m. Default zones were also updated to 200 and 300 m. Your current settings will not be affected by this change.

## Fake Auto-unlock cancelation events detection (preview)
Sometimes Android might deliver a fake geofence event that will cancel correctly started Auto-unlock. We added logic that based on geofence event accuracy will ignore an event that is most likely caused by location inaccuracy. You can turn this option in beta tester section of your user profile.

## Changes to Auto-unlock battery optimization popup
Auto-unlock is based on geofence events that are delivered to the app when it's working in background. Immediate event delivery is essential for the process to work correctly. Unfortunately, battery optimization often causes delays. That's why we introduced popups asking to disable it. However, showing them on each app start was too intrusive. We replaced it with a red dot leading to Auto-unlock settings, where you can manually launch the popup.
