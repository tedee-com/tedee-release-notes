## Added possibility to select Wi-Fi name in the Bridge settings from the list of all scanned networks
Configuring bridge WiFi settings will now be easier and feel more familiar. We added a list that will display available networks, all you have to do is just to provide a password.

## Fixed bug with showing system status page instead of the login page
Sometimes when re-sign bar was shown, it redirected to the system status page instead of the login page. This has been fixed.

## Updated minimum supported Android version to 8.0
From this version onwards only users of Android 8.0 and higher will be able to update the app. It will allow us to use the newest, more secure Android API. If you are using Android 6 or 7, you will be able to keep your app, but updates and support will no longer be provided.
