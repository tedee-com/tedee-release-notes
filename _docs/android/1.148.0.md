## Simplified permissions for Android 12

If Auto-unlock is disabled, our app will now not require location permission. In previous Android versions, it was needed for scanning Bluetooth devices. We also provided more detailed information about location permissions that need to be enabled for Auto-unlock in Android 12.

## Removed Auto-unlock notification on exiting range out zone

Previously we showed a notification about Auto-unlock service running while exit range out zone was received. We compressed the logic that needs to be run then, and now launching background service is not needed.

## Fixed problems with beacon Auto-unlock trigger

Users with more than one active Auto-unlock were sometimes not able to start the process using a beacon. We made sure that this trigger will now work correctly. 

## Fixed problems with increasing app size over time

App size was growing over time. We fixed the way we handle database so that the size will stay constant.
