## Optional quick configuration after adding lock
We added possibility to set up most used lock settings just after adding it. Now you will be able to change its name, share access to multiple persons and turn on auto-unlock.
All options can be later changed in lock settings.

Auto-unlock options will be set to default values.



## Added information about automatic update via bridge
If you have bridge, it will take care of updates of your devices (including itself). If this is the case, the hint will be shown on update page. The update will be performed in the night, when you are less like to use the devices.
