## Added keypad battery level status
You can now check keypad battery level. It will work the same way as for lock, with low battery warning on My Devices List and each keypad screen.
The exact battery level can be found in settings of keypad.

## Improved widget feedback
In order to open the lock from widget, you have to click it twice. From now, after first tap, icon will change to indicate that next click will invoke opening.

## Fixed issue with action widget not allowing to pull spring
It was not possible to pull spring from action widget. We fixed it so that it works as expected.

## Widget reliability improvements
Lock status on widget was not reliable if the device was not connected to the bridge. We decided to remove the status from widget in such cases.

We also fixed cases where widget was incorrectly stuck in one state.

## Added new splash screen for Android 12
We removed custom splash screen for Android 12. Users of this system version will see only the standard Android splash screen.
