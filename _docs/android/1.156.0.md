## Support for android 6 and 7 versions will end soon
In near future, we are planning to drop support for android 6 and 7 in our application. When this happens, our application running on those versions will still work but we do not guarantee for how long and application will no longer receive any updates. New users will not be able to install our app on android 6 and 7.
