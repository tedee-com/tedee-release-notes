## New languages
From now on, you can use tedee app in Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian

## Per app language support
On Android 13, there is a new option that allows using each app in a different language than the system one. We enabled this possibility in the tedee app.

## Added button to set current Wi-Fi name during bridge configuration.
While configuring bridge Wi-Fi, you can now fill its name with the one that your phone is connected to by clicking the button on the right of the name field.
