## Fixed spontaneous logging out
Some users reported being frequently logged out of the app. After investigation, we discovered that upper case letters in email caused this problem. Now, users with upper case letters in their emails will not be automatically logged out anymore.

## Improved lock settings sync
We refactored logic to update device settings. Now settings that are stored on the lock side will be synchronizing much faster.

## Updated design for the keypad battery type settings.
We improved battery type settings page to be more user friendly.

## Updated design for bridge requires activation on "My devices" list
Bridge after factory reset could have been sometimes shown as connected. We fixed this faulty state. Now it will look like other devices.
