## Changed bridge firmware update logic so that it will show error popup quicker
The timeout to show the connection error was too long. We decreased it and added a popup instead of showing a separate error page.

## Improved connection status check in the bridge pairing process
Sometimes we showed an error indicating that the bridge was not able to connect to lock in 30 seconds after pairing, despite actually being connected. Now we double-check connection status before showing that error.

## Fixed crash on edit PIN screen while clicking on a date in the past
In rare cases, when the end date was in the past, a click on the start date would cause the app to crash. We made sure such a situation will be handled in the app.

## Fixed problems with checking the internet connection state
Sometimes "No internet connection" bar was not shown despite the connection not being available. We improved the logic that checks it.
