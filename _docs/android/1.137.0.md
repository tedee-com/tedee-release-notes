## Added battery type settings for the keypad
There are two supported battery types that you can use with your Keypad. To see more accurate battery level measurements, select installed type under "Battery" settings option.

## New designs for "My devices" page
With more tedee devices available, we added new icons to better differentiate them. There were also more minor changes in device list appearance. Most notably - keypad connection status text will not be shown, as connection with this accessory is not kept at all times.
