## Introduced Matter support for Lock Go (requires firmware 2.1)

This release introduces **Matter support for Lock Go**, allowing the lock to integrate seamlessly with Matter-compatible smart home platforms. With this enhancement, users gain broader interoperability, easier setup, and improved flexibility when connecting their lock to different smart home systems.

To enable Matter, make sure your **Lock Go is updated to firmware version 2.1 or newer**. Once the lock is updated, you can add it to your Matter ecosystem and enjoy a unified smart home experience across supported apps and devices.


## Multiple Wi-Fi networks for Auto-unlock
You can now add several Wi-Fi networks (e.g., 2G, 5G) for auto-unlock by separating names with commas in the setup. The description now explains this option.
