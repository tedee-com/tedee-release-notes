## Auto-unlock for more than 2 locks
We changed logic to allow Auto-unlock to work on more locks. Now you should be able to have it active on up to 50 locks.

## Hidden unnecessary time zone warning
Recently we introduced warnings if your time zone is different than devices. It was shown also if both time zones offset was the same. It was unnecessary and confusing. We decided not to show it in such cases.

## Wrong offset shown in time zone name
Some of the time zones offsets were incorrectly shown due to not taking daylight savings time into account. If DST was active, the offset was one hour off. We made sure to always show the current offset.
