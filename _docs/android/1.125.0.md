## Bluetooth connection management 
All Bluetooth connections with devices will be closed after the app is in the background for more than one minute. After you bring the app to the foreground again, all connections will be restored. This is done to save resources of the devices.

## Force unlock released from preview
This feature allows you to force open lock via Bluetooth regardless of its connection status and the state shown in the app. You can find this option in lock settings.

## Fixed refreshing widgets logic
After clicking a gray button on the widget, the lock state will be refreshed. This will help with cases where an incorrect state was shown on the widget.
