## New: Incident bar for Blebox users
If there’s an active issue with Blebox integration, users with Blebox devices will now see a special incident bar in the app. This helps them quickly check the status and get updates. Other users won’t see this bar.

## New: "Lock Pulled by Auto Unlock" activity
A new event has been added to the lock activity history. It appears when the lock is pulled automatically by the Auto Unlock feature, helping users clearly see what happened.

## Improved: Retry logic for BLE lock actions
We improved how the app retries lock, unlock, and pull actions over BLE after a failed remote attempt, making operations more reliable.

## Improved: Lock actions from widget
Locking, unlocking, and pulling the lock from widgets now works more reliably.

## Improved: Firmware update confirmation flow
After a successful firmware update, the app now waits until the device reboots before confirming the update is complete. This applies to all devices.

## Fixed: Firmware update confirmation sent too early on Lock PRO
We fixed a bug where Lock PRO was showing the firmware update as finished too early, before the update was actually confirmed.
