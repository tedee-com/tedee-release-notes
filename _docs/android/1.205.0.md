## Improved user search when sharing access
We improved how you search for users when creating new access shares. You can now search better through your organization's users.

## Keypad settings now open directly
We removed the Keypad details view. Now, when you click on Keypad, it takes you directly to its settings.

## Check disconnected accessories reason
You can now see why an accessory is disconnected by clicking the "Disconnected" status on the accessory settings page.

## New bottom bar for Keypad with a PIN management tab
We added a new bottom bar for the Keypad. There is now a "PIN" tab where you can manage your PINs.
