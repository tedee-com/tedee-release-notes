## New Keypad connection logic
To save battery life, we changed when app connects to and disconnects from the keypad. The connection will now be kept only while keypad details screen is accessed.

## Added new Bluetooth permission for Android 12
Android 12 introduced new Bluetooth permissions. We'll now require Android 12 users to give tedee app these permissions in order to connect to devices.

## Keypad bell button notification will include lock name
For users with more than one lock, it was not obvious which bell button was rung. We added that information to the notification.

## Decreased number of keypad volume levels
The lowest keypad volume level was barely hearable. We removed it, now it will be possible to select between 2 volume levels.

## Fixed problem with auto log out
Some users might have been automatically logged out. We fixed that issue.

## Fixed "No access yet" info on clicking device disconnected status
After clicking disconnected status on device page, in a case when user has no access yet, sometimes no access start date was shown. We'll now show the correct date of access start.

## Fixed problems in setting lock location during Auto-unlock setup
Sometimes it was not possible to click confirm location button. We made sure that the button will always be clickable.
