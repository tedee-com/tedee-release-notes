## Fixed crash on serial number scanning page
Sometimes, while adding a new device, app crashed on scanning QR code page. This had been fixed.

## Fixed problem with added to share start time
When sharing device with time restricted access, some seconds were unnecessarily added. E.g. if the current time is 12:15:43, and you set start time in app to 13:00, the actual starting time would be 13:00:43. We made sure, that from now on, seconds would always be set to 0.

## Fixed "You were logged out" bar showing too often
There are many reasons why "You were logged out" bar is shown. We discovered 2 cases, where you do not need to provide credentials again. The sign in bar should now be shown less often.

## Fixed layout issues when bridge name is long
When bridge name was long, it caused layout problems on some low-resolution devices. We made sure, that your bridge name will not be trimmed anymore.
