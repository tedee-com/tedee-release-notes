## 'Force unlock' renamed to 'troubleshooting'
We renamed 'Force unlock' section in Lock settings, so that it indicates more clearly what options it contains.

## Fixed problem with invalid time zones
Some smartphones were able to set time zone that was not recognized by our API. We corrected such devices and we made sure that such time zones will not be set again.

## Improved Auto-unlock stability
We fixed 'no range out zone error' incorrectly cancelling Auto-unlock. There were cases when it was reported when we got Bluetooth error during scanning for Lock on exiting Auto-unlock zone.
