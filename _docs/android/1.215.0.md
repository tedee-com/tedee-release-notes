## New Bottom Bar Navigation for Bridge
We have added a new bottom bar navigation for the Bridge. The paired devices view now has its own â€œPaired" tab. The old Bridge details page is removed, so you will be taken directly to the Bridge Settings page.

## New Bottom Bar Navigation for Lock
We also introduced a new bottom bar navigation for the Lock section. You will see four clear options on the lock page, making it easier to find what you need.
