## Added "pairing with bridge" status screens in lock adding process

During adding lock process, we automatically pair your new device with available bridges. The pairing process indication was easy to miss, so we added new screens explicitly stating the result of the process.

## Added "pairing with locks" status screens in bridge adding process

Similarly, we pair your new bridge with available locks. We also added screens that will show pairing result.

## Fixed problem with custom fonts not being used in some parts of the app

Several texts in the app were using system font instead of tedee app font. Users with custom system font reported inconsistent app appearance. From now on, the system font should not be visible in the app.

## Fixed problem with bridge Wi-Fi name validation

The app allowed to set a Wi-Fi name that is longer than the maximum length supported by the bridge. In such cases, the bridge wasn't able to connect to the network, but the app didn't show the proper reason for failure. We made sure that such a situation will no longer be possible.
