## Added Hold to unlock additional settings
There is now new hold to unlock setting - automatic. When selected, all locks with Auto-unlock turned on will require hold to unlock based on your location. When you are out of Auto-unlock zone, hold will be required, then in zone clicking unlock button will be enough. If your position is unknown (i.e. location is turned off) hold to unlock will be required for all locks with Auto-unlock turned on.
