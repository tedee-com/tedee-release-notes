Sometimes it was not possible to connect to the bridge via Bluetooth. We completely rewrote the logic, so that it will be more reliable.

## Reduced frequency of showing login screen on Wear OS 
Tedee Wear OS app used to frequently show the sign in screen to reauthenticate. now each time the mobile app refreshes its access token and your wearable is connected to mobile, the token will also be refreshed on Wear OS. Now you will see the screen below less frequently.

## Fixed crash on disconnected lock click
When you didn't have access to lock and click on it on the details page, the app would crash instead of showing a popup with access details. We made sure that the correct message will be now displayed.
