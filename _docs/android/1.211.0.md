## Auto-Lock Improvements

We improved the auto-lock setting for the Lock. If the user sets both “From unlocked” and “From semi-locked” to the same time, these options will now combine into one “After timer” option. If both are turned off, they will also merge into a single “After timer” option. We have also updated the design for this feature.
