## Swipe to Unlock
This feature is now available to all users! You can unlock your device with a simple swipe directly from the My Device page, making access quicker and more intuitive.

## Privacy Policy Confirmation
On your first launch, before signing in or creating an account, you’ll see a confirmation popup. This ensures you’ve read and accepted our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. The popup includes direct links to both documents so you can review them before accepting.

{: .note }
This popup will only appear for new installations. If you already have the app installed, you won’t see this prompt.

## Improved Navigation
All links to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use now open in your default browser instead of an in-app web view. This change provides a smoother and more familiar browsing experience.

## Fixed: Missing door state after Lock GO updates
Resolved missing door state statuses that could occur after Lock GO firmware updates.

## Improved: Auto-unlock behavior
Improved Auto-Unlock to prevent connecting or unlocking until the screen becomes active, reducing premature or unintended actions.
